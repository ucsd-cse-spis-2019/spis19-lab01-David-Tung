# David Cao, Tung Doan - Picobot Empty Room - Lab 1

# Move the bot to the left side.
# We check if there's a wall to the bot's west; if there isn't,
# keep moving west. Otherwise, switch to state 3, which begins
# the up-and-down sweeping motion.
0 **x* -> W 0
0 **W* -> X 3

# Start sweeping up and down
# In state 3, we move up until we hit a wall, at which point we switch
# to state 4, where we move down until we hit a wall. After hitting a
# wall, we move east to move to the next column and move back to state
# 3.
