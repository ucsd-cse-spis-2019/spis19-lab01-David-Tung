# David Cao, Tung Doan - Picobot Maze - Lab 1
# Each state corresponds to a direction to go in, and works
# similarly to all the other states. This bot follows the
# right hand rule. If there is no wall in front of it, it
# will move forward and switch to the state corresponding to
# turning clockwise, to check if it can follow the rule by
# turning into a corner. If there is a wall, it attempts to
# turn counter-clockwise to follow the right-hand rule on the
# wall it is currently facing.
